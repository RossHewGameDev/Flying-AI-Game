# Flying-AI-Game
This is a 3D pathfinding AI that uses the Theta* pathfinding algorithm to fly a plane through a 3D space. This also includes a flight controller for a player.

### Cell.cs
This script defines the Cell class used in Unity for pathfinding. It represents individual cell objects with properties such as traversability, world position, grid coordinates (X, Y, Z), and cost values (gCost, hCost, and fCost). 
### CellMapping.cs
The CellMapping script is an integral part of the Theta* pathfinding implementation. It generates a cell map for pathfinding, defines individual cell properties, and provides functions for finding cell neighbors and converting world positions to cells. The script also includes references for understanding A* and Theta* algorithms and offers in-scene visual debugging for pathfinding and obstacle detection.
### FlightPhys.cs
The FlightPhys script serves as the core of the flight physics system for controlling an agent's flight behavior in Unity. It handles the agent's speed, rotation, pitch, yaw, and roll, making it an essential component for implementing realistic flight mechanics. This script also includes collision detection and avoidance logic, allowing the agent to react appropriately when encountering obstacles. It's a crucial component for creating flying gameplay in Unity projects.
### Pathfinder.cs
The "Pathfinder" script is a versatile pathfinding system that employs the Theta* algorithm to find optimal paths in grid-based environments. It offers an optional Any-Angle A* pathfinding mode and includes customizable parameters like raycast max distance for line-of-sight checks. This script collaborates with the "CellMapping" component to create grid-based maps and supports complex pathfinding scenarios. It provides detailed references and resources for understanding and implementing pathfinding algorithms.
### PathingManager.cs
The "PathingManager" script serves as the central manager for handling path requests and coordinating communication between agents and the pathfinding system. It manages a queue of path requests from agents, processes these requests, and invokes the pathfinding algorithm to calculate optimal paths. The script supports multiple agents and provides a callback mechanism to deliver the calculated paths to requesting agents. It follows a design inspired by Sebastian Lague's tutorial, ensuring efficient path request handling and processing.
Note: The script primarily focuses on path request management and does not contain the pathfinding algorithm itself, which is implemented in the "Pathfinder" component.
### Statemachine.cs
The "Statemachine" script is responsible for controlling the actions and behavior of a glider agent in a game environment. The script manages the glider's decision-making process and determines its current "MindState," which can be either "Idle" or "Fleeing." The glider's primary objective is to escape from the player within specific parameters.
### ThetaAgent.cs
The "ThetaAgent" script represents an agent in a game environment that follows a path generated by a Theta* pathfinder. This agent regenerates its path based on information provided by a "Statemachine" script, which controls its behavior. The agent's primary goal is to navigate through the game world by following a generated path.
